# Cable Spool

very simple cable spool, mostly to learn openscad


## notations
> [!NOTE]
> seperated the model in two half's, because faster print time and no supports are needed

> [!TIP]
> for the full model just glue the two half's together

## TODO

Might finish off items out of order since I usually work on multiple at a time.
